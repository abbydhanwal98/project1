DATABINDING

typescript code   =========================>   HTML code
                   OUTPUTS DATA
                   string interpolation(  {{data}} )
                   property binding( [property]="data" )

                   <========================
                   Event Binding( (event)="expression" )

Combination of Both : two way binding (  [(ngModel)]="data"   )
